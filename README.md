Hi, I'm Amber Adams!

I love all kinds of technology, and have been self-teaching languages and softwares for as long as I have had computers. 
I started learning Python in high school, around 15 years old, and this has become my language of choice for most applications because of its flexibility.
I also have experience with Java, R, SQL, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS; and I have basic familiarity with C++ and Go.
Currently, I am self-studying NoSQL databases.

I am also in tbe process of transferring many of my projects from the past decade to this GitHub account, from the various places where they are stored.
Even so, please take a look at what I currently have here.

Thank you for visiting!
